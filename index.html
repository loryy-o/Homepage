        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>I'm a 17 year old full-stack developer, hobbyist UX designer and licensed drone operator, and I was born in Italy. I'm currently studying <strong>software engineering</strong> and I'm following an internship program at a local software house. I started tinkering with computers as young as 9 years old, which got me to consistently and <em>(almost)</em> effortlessly learn new things about them. I have a few hobbies, and they're completely disconnected from eachother: they range from programming <em>(shocking, right?)</em> to clubbing.</p>
        
        <h2>My competences</h2>
        <p>I specialize in Discord bots, authentication systems and I've been lately learning memory manipulation. I'm also a <strong>huge</strong> cryptography guy. I do not have a UX design portfolio, but I'm working to bring some examples of what i can do.<br>Here is an up to date list of what i can do:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>C++</strong> (Advanced knowledge, focused on memory manipulation)</li>
            <li><strong>Python</strong> (Advanced knowledge)</li>
            <li><strong>HTML & CSS</strong> (Well, that was obvious. I also use Tailwind)</li>
            <li><strong>JavaScript & Node.js</strong> (Advanced knowledge, fluent with Discord.js and React.js)</li>
            <li><strong>Java</strong> (Advanced knowledge, focused on Forge development)</li>
            <li><strong>Lua</strong> (Advanced knowledge, focused on LuaU)</li>
            <li><strong>C#</strong> (Moderate knowledge)</li>
            <li><strong>Go</strong> (Moderate knowledge)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Past work</h2>
        <p>Due to the nature of of my creations (most, if not all of them were integrated in closed source projects) I cannot publicly release any source codes. I can, however, privately showcase them. You can contact me via any of the options below.</p>
        <h2>Contacts</h2>
        <p>You can contact me if you have any questions or commissions, I'll respond as soon as possible.</p>

        <footer>
            <p>Yes, I like simple websites (and i <strong>really</strong> cant be bothered to make a proper one). This website is inspired <span style="font-size: 10px;">(stolen?)</span> from <strong><a href="https://evenbettermotherfucking.website">here</a></strong>.</p>
